# Installation

Getting started with Formail is easy and flexible. You can integrate Formail into your applications either by using our convenient `formail-hooks` package or by making a `POST` request. Below, you'll find instructions for both methods.

## Obtaining Your Form ID

Before integrating Formail, you'll need a unique Form ID for your form. Here's how to obtain it:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Log in to your dashboard:

Visit [Formail Dashboard](https://www.formail.dev/dashboard).

</Step>
<Step>
### Create a new form:

If you haven't already created a form, you can do so by clicking the "Create New Form" button.

</Step>
<Step>
### Copy your Form ID:

Once your form is created, you'll find a Form ID associated with it. Copy this ID as you will need it for the integration process.

</Step>

</Steps>
## Using `formail-hooks`

For a more streamlined integration, you can utilize our `formail-hooks` package.

### Installation

First, install the package via npm:

```bash copy
npm install formail-hooks
```

### Usage

Here's how to use the hook in a React component:

```jsx copy
import { useFormail } from "formail-hooks";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { handleSubmit } = useFormail("<YOUR_FORM_ID>");

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="email" name="email" required />
      <textarea name="message" required></textarea>
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

## Without using `formail-hooks`

If you prefer to handle submissions manually or are not using our package, you can make a direct POST request to our endpoint.

```js copy
const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const formId = "<your-form-id>";
  const data = new FormData(event.target);

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://www.formail.dev/submit/${formId}`, {
      method: "POST",
      body: data,
    });
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Form submission failed");
    console.log("Form submitted successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

Replace `<YOUR_FORM_ID>` with your actual Form ID. The body of the request should contain the form data you wish to submit. \*/}
