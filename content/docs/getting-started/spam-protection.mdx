# Spam Protection

Every form is susceptible to spambots, and the way you handle them can significantly impact your user experience. Formail offers robust solutions to combat spam effectively, ensuring that your forms remain secure and your data stays clean.

## Spam Protection Solutions

Formail integrates several advanced tools to help protect your forms from spam:

- **[Akismet](https://akismet.com)** Integration
- **Custom Spam Words**

Formail ensures that your submission integrity is maintained by not saving submissions, send notifications, or decrement your remaining submissions under the following conditions:

- The submission is empty.
- The spam protection verification was unsuccessful.

## Upcoming Integrations

We are actively working on expanding our spam protection tools to include integrations with leading captcha services. These upcoming features will provide additional layers of security, ensuring even stronger defenses against spam and automated attacks.

## Askimet

Formail integrates seamlessly with Akismet to filter out spam. This integration is pre-activated for all accounts, requiring no additional setup from users.

## Custom Spam Words

Custom spam words enable you to block submissions containing specific words you identify as indicative of spam.

All values within the submission body of your form are scanned for the specified words. If any of these words are detected, the submission is automatically classified and discarded as spam.

To set up this feature, enter a comma-separated list of spam words in your formâ€™s settings under the "Custom Spam Words" section. The total length of this list must not exceed 2,500 characters.
