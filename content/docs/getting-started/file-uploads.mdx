# File Uploads

## Coming Soon

We are excited to announce that file uploads will soon be available on our platform for our **premium users**. This feature is designed to enhance your form management capabilities, allowing you to receive files directly through the forms you deploy.

### Key Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate file upload fields into your existing forms with minimal configuration.
- **Secure Storage**: All files are stored securely, ensuring that your data remains safe at all times.
- **Efficient Management**: Access and manage uploaded files directly from your dashboard.

### Why Paid?

Offering file uploads involves significant resources on our end, from increased storage requirements to enhanced security measures. By limiting this feature to our paid plans, we can ensure that our infrastructure and support teams are well-equipped to handle your needs effectively.

## Stay Tuned

We are working hard to bring this feature to you as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for choosing us to empower your form management needs. If you have any questions or would like to express interest in early access to file uploads, please contact our support team.
