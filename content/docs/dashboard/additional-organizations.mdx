# Adding New Organizations

## Coming Soon

At Formail, we are constantly enhancing our platform to better serve your needs. Soon, you will be able to add and manage multiple organizations directly within your dashboard. This new feature is designed to streamline how you manage different projects or teams within our platform.

## Feature Overview

### Premium Access

The ability to add new organizations will be exclusively available to our premium users. This feature allows for greater flexibility and control over how you manage various aspects of your form submissions across different organizational units.

### Powered by Clerk

To ensure seamless management of organizations and users, we are integrating Clerk into our platform. Clerk provides advanced tools for handling authentication and user management, making it easy for you to manage access and permissions within your organizations.

## How It Will Work

While this feature is still under development, here’s a brief overview of how we expect it to function:

1. **Dashboard Integration**: You’ll be able to add new organizations directly from your Formail dashboard.
2. **Clerk Integration**: Through Clerk, you’ll manage users and permissions for each organization, ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.
3. **Custom Configuration**: Set up each organization with custom settings, including form configurations, submission handling, and notification preferences.

## Stay Tuned

We are working hard to bring this feature to you. Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your patience as we work to make our service even better. Keep an eye on our announcements for more information on when this feature will go live.
