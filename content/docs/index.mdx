# What is Formail?

Formail streamlines form management, offering instant notifications and
flexible data handling. Ideal for developers and small businesses, it
simplifies submission processes, making them user-friendly and
efficient.

## Simplifying Form Managment

Handling form submissions can be cumbersome, which is why we
streamline the process for you. Currently, we're enhancing form
management with efficient data handling and with more features on the
horizon.

This is the core service we offer, and our pricing structure is
straightforward and transparent.

## Centralized Submission Processing

With Formail, form submissions are seamlessly directed to
`formail.dev/submit/<your-form-id>`, a secure endpoint
we manage. This approach centralizes data processing, relieving you of
the direct server management burden.

This system is built to ensure that while you retain control over form
design and integration, the heavy lifting of data handling is managed
efficiently by our infrastructure, offering a blend of convenience and
reliability.

## Streamlined Integration for any framework

Formail provides an open-source [TypeScript Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formail-hooks), designed to be framework-agnostic, enabling easy data submissions to
our servers.

Simplifying form submissions becomes effortless with our library:

```jsx
import { formailSubmit } from "formail-hooks";

function MyForm() {
  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formId = "your-unique-form-id";
    try {
      await formailSubmit({ formId, formData: new FormData(e.target) });
      console.log("Form submitted successfully");
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Form submission failed:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
