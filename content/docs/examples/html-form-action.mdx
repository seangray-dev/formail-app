# HTML Form Action

After you've created a form in the Formail dashboard, you can integrate it directly into your HTML forms. This method is straightforward and works great for static sites and those preferring a server-less approach.

Simply set the form action to `https://formail.dev/submit/<YOUR_FORM_ID>` and the method to `POST`, replacing your `<YOUR_FORM_ID>` with your actual form id obtained from your form page.

```html copy
<form action="https://formail.dev/submit/<YOUR_FORM_ID>" method="POST">
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

## Form validation

It's recommended using HTML5's built in validation attributes to ensure the form is filled out correctly before submission.

Here's an example of how you can add required fields to the form:

```html copy
<form action="https://formail.dev/submit/<YOUR_FORM_ID>" method="POST">
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  <textarea name="message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```
